# Username Feature Implementation

## Overview
The username feature allows professionals to be found via their username and have public profile URLs like `domain.com/username`. This is a custom URL feature for enhanced professional discoverability.

## Implementation Status

### âœ… Completed
1. **Database Schema Updates**
   - Added `username` field to User model in Prisma schema
   - Field is optional (`String?`) with unique constraint
   - Added database index for efficient username lookups
   - Located in: `prisma/schema.prisma`

2. **Cache Service Integration**
   - Added `USER_PROFILE_BY_USERNAME` cache key generator
   - Supports username-based profile caching for performance
   - Located in: `src/services/CacheService.ts`

3. **API Routes Implementation**
   - Created new profiles route file: `src/routes/profiles.ts`
   - Integrated with main app routing in: `src/app.ts`
   - Added API documentation for profiles endpoints

4. **API Endpoints**
   - `GET /api/profiles/check/:username` - Check username availability
   - `GET /api/profiles/:username` - Get public profile by username

### ðŸ”„ Pending Database Migration
The username field exists in the Prisma schema but requires a database migration to be applied to the production PostgreSQL database.

## API Endpoints

### Check Username Availability
**GET** `/api/profiles/check/:username`

Validates username format and checks availability.

**Parameters:**
- `username` (string): Username to check (3-20 characters, alphanumeric, hyphens, underscores)

**Response:**
```json
{
  "username": "normalizedusername",
  "available": true|false,
  "message": "Username is available" | "Username is already taken"
}
```

**Validation Rules:**
- 3-20 characters long
- Only letters, numbers, hyphens, and underscores allowed
- Case insensitive (normalized to lowercase)

### Get Public Profile by Username
**GET** `/api/profiles/:username`

Retrieves comprehensive public profile data for a professional.

**Parameters:**
- `username` (string): The username to look up

**Response:**
```json
{
  "id": "user_id",
  "username": "username",
  "name": "Professional Name",
  "role": "CREATIVE_PROFESSIONAL|EVENT_PLANNER",
  "location": "City, Country",

        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Current Status
- **Development**: Fully implemented with graceful fallbacks
- **Production**: Ready for deployment (requires database migration)
- **Testing**: Available for username availability checking (returns available status during setup)

## Next Steps for Production

1. **Database Migration**
   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate deploy
   ```

2. **Full Feature Activation**
   - Once migration is complete, remove fallback logic
   - Enable full username-based profile functionality

3. **Frontend Integration**
   - Add username setting in user profile
   - Implement public profile pages
   - Add username-based routing

## Security Considerations
- Username validation prevents injection attacks
- Profile visibility respects privacy settings
- Rate limiting applies to all endpoints
- Sensitive information (exact rates) is hidden in public profiles
- Caching prevents database overload

## Performance Features
- Comprehensive caching for profile data
- Database indexes for efficient username lookups
- Graceful error handling and fallbacks
- Optimized queries with selective field retrieval

## Error Handling
- Validates username format before database queries
- Graceful fallbacks when database migration is pending
- Comprehensive error logging for debugging
- User-friendly error messages
