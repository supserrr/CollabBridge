## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

We take the security of CollabBridge seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

### How to Report a Security Vulnerability

Please send an email to security@collabbridge.com with the following information:

- Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

### Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours.
- **Initial Assessment**: We will provide an initial assessment within 5 business days.
- **Resolution**: We aim to resolve critical vulnerabilities within 30 days.

### Safe Harbor

We support responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities. We will not pursue legal action against researchers who:

- Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, and interruption or degradation of our services
- Only interact with accounts you own or with explicit permission of the account holder
- Do not access a system or account beyond what is necessary to demonstrate the vulnerability
- Report the vulnerability promptly
- Do not disclose the vulnerability until it has been resolved
